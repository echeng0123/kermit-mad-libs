# kermit-mad-libs

My first mobile app! This app is a play on the game Mad Libs, and allows users to input responses to prompt to create humorous stories. My goals for this project were to get familiar with the mobile development pipeline, React Native, and get experience developing for mobile apps. 

Built with Javascript, React Native, CSS, and Expo.
